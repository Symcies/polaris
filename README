Building Using cmake
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can download cmake from here http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.12-win32-x86.zip
Make sure it is added to the PATH

Open CmakeLists.txt and make sure that BOOST_ROOT is set up properly

run the following commands:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G"Visual Studio 10 Win64" ..

This will generate a polaris.sln file you can open in Visual Studio 10

Switch to MinSizeRel and build
